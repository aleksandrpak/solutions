#Problem Statement

At Booking.com we allow users to search accommodations in over 80,000 destinations around the world. We want to improve the userâ€™s experience by suggesting destinations that are similar to the ones they've just searched for.

To identify similar destinations, we can use tags entered by our users during the review process. These tags look like this:

```
london    : theatre, museums, monuments, food, parks, architecture, nightlife
amsterdam : museums, shopping, architecture, nightlife, cycling, food, walking
berlin    : monuments, nightlife, food, architecture, city_trip
paris     : shopping, food, monuments, architecture, gourmet, walking, museums
barcelona : architecture, shopping, beach, food, tapas, nightlife
```

Using these tags, we want to create groups of destinations based on tag similarity. Destinations belong to a group if they have at least n tags in common.

For example, using the above tags, the possible unique groups with at least 4 tags in common are shown here:

```
amsterdam, paris     (5 tags in common: architecture, food, museums, shopping, walking)
london, paris        (4 tags in common: architecture, food, monuments, museums)
berlin, london       (4 tags in common: architecture, food, monuments, nightlife)
amsterdam, london    (4 tags in common: architecture, food, museums, nightlife)
amsterdam, barcelona (4 tags in common: architecture, food, nightlife, shopping)
```

#Input Format

The first line of the input is the minimum number of common tags required to create a group. This number is always greater than one and smaller than 1000.

The next lines each specify a destination and its tags. First there is the destination name followed by a colon, then the tags appear separated by commas. Destination names and tags only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. There are no spaces in the lines.

The destination names and tags are all in english. It is safe to read the input as ASCII. The destination names and tags can have between 1 and 255 characters. The input can contain up to 1,000 destinations. And there will be no more than 1,000 unique tags in total. Each destination might have up to 200 tags.

#Output Format

Each line of the output starts with the destinations composing each group sorted alphabetically and separated by commas. Then a colon character and then the common tags of the group also sorted alphabetically and also separated by commas.

There should be no spaces in the output. Groups must be unique, which means that there can not be two or more groups with the exact same destinations. The tags for a group must be all the common tags, but groups with less common tags than the minimum number provided in the input should not appear in the output.

The lines should be sorted by the length of the groups, with those groups with more tags in common appearing first. If two or more groups have the same number of common tags, the lines should be sorted alphabetically.
