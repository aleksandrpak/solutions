
The format of this document is as follows:

CODE:
	<CODE>    -   This is the SGML code that is being described.
FUNCTION:
	A brief description of the code.
PARAMETERS:

			 if a parameter is present, the actual code found in 
			 the file will be <CODE PARAM=VALUE>.  The (R) means 
			 that the parameter is required.  An (O) means that the

FUNCTION:
	Specifies the beginning of a form of the current lemma's orthography.
	Various processing is done on the text between this code and its end
	code in the database extract program, most notably the substitution of
	an abbreviation for the lemma for the text between the codes.  Also,
	depending on the placement of these code in relation to other codes, 
	this code may signal a typeface change to italics, so it will be
	specified at the description of those codes whether dfl italics is
	inhibited or not.

	The first thing that this code does is save the current font style,
	which is then restores at the </DFL> code.  If no parameters are then
	specified and dfl italics are not inhibited, then the typeface is
	changed to italics.

	If one of the parameters is specified, and that parameter is not
	FOL=ABBREV, and dfl italics are not inhibited, then the typeface is
	changed to italics.
