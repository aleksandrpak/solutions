#. radicular arteries: What the meaning of words "spinal arteries , segmental medullary arteries.". If it is synonyms, it should be placed in separate line with prefix "Synonyms: ". Also, extra space before comma here. (!!! These references are eliminated !!!) Also, word "Syn:" should be replaced to "Synonyms: ".

General issues:

#. "See" and "See also" sections should be eliminated if there are no such word in dictionary (but not "Synonyms"). See "Aarskog".
#. I would add alias "Xe" for "133Xe" and all such words.
#. In headwords like "(anterior and posterior) radicular arteries" we should remove data in parenthesizes, because it makes no sense for using in suggestions: "(anterior and posterior) radicular arteries" à "radicular arteries"
#. Lists should be created using div with class ds-list. See tfd.com. Otherwise, you should place all article text in div with class ds-single.
#. Extra spaces before dots and after links.
#. We should remove all extra spaces and all line breaks from html ("txt")
